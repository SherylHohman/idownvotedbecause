{::comment}Trying a different tone in this one, referring to the OP as "we" instead of "you"{:/}
## It appears no attempt was made {#introduction}
We all have jobs to do. It may be homework, or work-work. No matter what, it's our responsibility to get the job done. And when it seems like our task is too hard or we don't know where to start, it is always worth the effort to at least try.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
We can't rely on other people to do our work for us. Asking others to do our work for us can also be seen as rude. If we try, we may succeed. But if we do not, we will always fail. And if we **did try**, without sharing our efforts with others, they may *duplicate our work instead of providing a working solution*.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
It can be seen as very rude to ask other people to do our work for us. People will look and see if we made any effort at all, and if they see none, they may look upon us as lazy, and act negatively toward us, downvoting our question and voting to close. Without making an attempt, we may not even know where our real problem lies. People may spend time answering our question, suggesting things that we would have already been able to accomplish, and not things that we *truly* would have needed help with. This **wastes the time of those volunteering to help** us, and doesn't solve our problem at all.

If we *have* made an effort, but we failed to detail **exactly what we did** in our question, then this can result in duplicated effort on the part of those trying to help us. That's a waste of their time, and makes it harder for us to get a proper answer.

And, in some cases, our question may *itself* be a waste of **our time**. The effort to fix our problem may have been less than to ask the question in the first place! A simple search, a little debugging, and it would have been solved. And, if asking our question was a waste of *our* time, it was **definitely** a waste of the time of people trying to help us.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
If we have made an effort, we should immediately edit our question to detail exactly what we did. Adding "I googled and found nothing" is not helpful. We should detail what we researched *for*, and point to any links that were helpful but that did not answer our question. If we've tried to code a solution, that should be added in an edit. Our attempts should be turned into a [minimal, complete, verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) so it is clear to read and understand.

If we have not made an effort, and no one has answered our question yet, we should delete it immediately. Keep the link to the question, as we may need it again. We should go and make an attempt to fix our problem. Research more, and keep track of what we looked for, what we found, and why it didn't help. We should create a small prototype that isolates our issue. Make one or more attempts to accomplish our goals. If we still cannot find a solution, return to the question. We can edit it and add these details in. Once finished, the question can be undeleted--it has enough information for people to answer it correctly.

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
